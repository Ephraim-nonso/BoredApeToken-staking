# TOKEN STAKING WITH NFT WHITELIST

This project is a token staking contract, of which the prerequisite for staking, is the possession of one Bored Ape NFT or more and ownership of the native token for the token market. 

Having met the requirement for staking, stakers have benefits of 10% at the end of the month based on their desired staked amount. Withdrawal of reward is based on the condition that stakers' stake must last for up to 3 days or more before the contracts gives them the liberty to withdraw or stake more, for additionaal rewards.

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```
